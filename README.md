# MultiscaleSelection_SI

Simulation code, data and scripts belonging to the SI-model in the manuscript "Multiscale selection in spatially structured poulations" by Hilje M. Doekes and Rutger Hermsen.

Simulation code is written in C and uses the FFTW (http://www.fftw.org) and CASH2 libraries. See READMEs in SI_Model and SI_Model/Model.

Analysis and visualisation scripts are written in R (https://www.r-project.org). All simulation data used for the figures can be found in Scripts/Data.
