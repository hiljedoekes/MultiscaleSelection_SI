CASH, Cash2 and all its extensions were developed by members of the Theoretical Biology and Bioinformatics group at Utrecht University (https://tbb.bio.uu.nl): 

CASH was developed by Rob de Boer and Alex Starisky (v. 2003)
Cash2 and Cash2-s were developed by Nobuto Takeuchi (v. 2007)
Additions and improvements were subsequently made by various TBB members, including Thomas Cuypers, Bram Van Dijk, and Hilje Doekes.

******************
* How to install *
******************

*** The easiest way ***

Within your Cash folder, type the following:

make
make install

NOTE: Whenever you make changes to the Cash functions (files cash2.c/h and cash2-s.c/h) or the TYPE2 struct (file cash2.h), Cash has to be recompiled.
Code that depends on the specifics of the TYPE2 struct is labeled //StructChange


To compile a model that uses Cash, change to folder where model code is stored and type the following:

make <model-name>

The Model folder should be a subdirectory of the Cash folder that you use, and should contain its own makefile.


*** A non-easiest way ***

Modify the makefile in the cash2-s directory appropriately, such that models and cash2 code are all recompiled in one go.
